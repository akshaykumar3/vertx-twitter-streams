###TODO:
- Integrate some nice and fancy UI for the vertx server
- Parse the JSON response from twitter API

Steps:
- Register a new app here - https://apps.twitter.com/
- Fill out necessary details and create a new app
- This will generate consumer key and consumer secret for your app
  - Generate a new access token and secret with read (and write) permissions
  - Add these configs to application.properties in the root directory
- Run ```gradle execute``` on the terminal/shell
- Vertx server is running on http://localhost:8080
